Part A: Construction of Corpus – Fetching 10-Q and 10-K forms from EDGAR

Part B: Sentiment association with Financial Indicators

Part C: Topic Modelling and Latent Dirichlet allocation

The first part (Part A) covers constructing and demonstrating the handling of text data. In spercific, familiar with the principles of text mining, the bag-of-words model and the development of metrics that can be used to analyse structural elements of text, such as normalizing and cleaning textual corpora. 

The core of this project involves the translation of these insights to actionable features that can be used to predict an outcome variable of financial interest: the stock price value. 

Therefore the second and third parts (Part B and Part C) are concerned with the identification of features and in particular (a) polarity – whether the text under consideration is positive or negative, (b) sentiment – the extraction of affective states from the text and (c) the evaluation and extraction of important topics that are covered and elaborated in the quarterly and annual financial reports (10-Q, 10-K) and the predictability of these insights on a company, sector and market level (Part C).
